A simple CLI hangman game created entirely to learn Go's syntax. Uses the `/usr/share/dict/words` list found on *nix systems.

Possible future additions:
* Allow selecting min and max world length.
* Calculating number of guesses based on word lengh; difficulty setting.
* An interface that overwrites itself rather than printing extra lines to stdout every turn.
